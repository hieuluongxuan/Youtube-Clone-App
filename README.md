**Simplify Your YouTube App CI/CD with GitLab**

The complexity of managing development workflows for apps like a YouTube clone can be a headache. Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) with GitLab provides a powerful solution to streamline and automate these processes.

In this step-by-step tutorial, I walked through setting up a complete CI/CD pipeline for a React YouTube app clone using GitLab. The pipeline included:

- Automated testing with SonarQube to check code quality
- Security scanning with Trivy to detect vulnerabilities
- Building and publishing a Docker container image
- Deploying the containerized app to an EC2 instance

With the GitLab CI/CD integration, the entire workflow from code commit to deployment was automated. The tutorial covered:

- Configuring GitLab CI/CD variables and environment
- Writing a .gitlab-ci.yml file to define pipeline stages
- Installing and registering a GitLab runner to execute jobs
- Building, scanning, and deploying the app without manual intervention

The end result was a robust DevOps solution to streamline development and delivery of a YouTube-like app. CI/CD removed tedious tasks and enabled rapid iteration.
